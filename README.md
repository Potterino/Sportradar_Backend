# Sportradar_Backend

OVERVIEW:

This application task/project is a basic relational database system with a scalable structure of tables and a basic frontend. It's in the 3rd normal form normalization, so there are no transitive dependencies and every entry is functionally dependent on a primary key. 
For demonstration I applied a function to import the test data which was sent in a JSON format into the specified databases tables.
